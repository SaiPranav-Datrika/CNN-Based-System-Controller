# CNN-Based-System-Controller

For handling various devices around us a lot of mechanical work need to be performed. To
reduce this impact on the human beings we have designed a controller in which objects can be
managed by hand gestures. Hand gestures are very common in daily life, it is used as a medium
of communication between people to describe any aspect. Thus, we have used this technique
to control the objects in between us. There are many other ways to control the devices but this
method helps human to control the devices in a safe and comfortable user interface for diverse
applications.


The main aim of the project is to take the input as a hand gesture and produce the output to
identify the devices like light, fan, motor, doors etc.. to be controlled in the surroundings and
to create the modern way of lifestyle to the people. To develop such a user interface we have
used feed forward artificial neural networks such as Convolution Neural Network (CNN) with
keras in python. This model is used to classify the hand gesture that has sent as input to the
system and give a required output to control the device with the help of hand gesture.
